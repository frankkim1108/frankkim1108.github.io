## Change Output file format

The original output format currently is .blend format. However, for my personal project I need the file format to be in .gltf or .glb because it is easier to open these type of file on mobile.

1. under `const.py` file change the `BASE_FORMAT = ".blend"` to `BASE_FORMAT = ".gltf"`
2. under `system.ini` file change the `out_format = ".blend"` to `out_format = ".gltf"`

Then the glb file will be created.

However currently the gltf file is not created correctly so it has to be fixed.
