## **Different way of detecting doors and windows**

### **`def find_details()`**

**Parameters**
- img : gray scale image of the room, also eroded and doors removed
- noise_removal_threshold : Minimal area of blobs to be kept
- corners_threshold : Threshold to allow corners. (Higher removes more of the house) 
- room_closing_max_length : Maximum line length to add to close off open doors.
- gap_in_wall_threshold : Minimum number of pixels to identify componenet as room instead of hole in the wall

**Return**
- returns a list of numpy arrays containing boolean masks for each detected details
- colored image: A colored version of the input image, where each detail has a random color

**Function**
1. Noise is removed from the image
2. Harris Corner Detection is used to detect corners and lines are drawn between corners
   - $\displaystyle \boldsymbol{M = \sum_{x,y} w(x,y) \begin{bmatrix} I_xI_x & I_xI_y \\ I_xI_y & I_yI_y \end{bmatrix}}$
   - $\displaystyle \boldsymbol{M} $'s eigen values $\displaystyle \boldsymbol{\lambda_1, \lambda_2}$
   - $\displaystyle \boldsymbol{ R = \lambda_1\lambda_2 - k(\lambda_1\lambda_2)^2 }$
3. The image is inverted and the outside of the hosue is marked as black
4. Connected componenets in the house is found
5. The componenets within the right range is considered as window and doors
