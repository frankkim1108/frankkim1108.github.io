## **Detect Rooms**
1. Get wall image and inverse it
2. find_rooms is used to find rooms
3. Rooms are drawn onto the original image

### **detect.py [find_rooms]**
- params
    - img:gray scale image of rooms 
    - noise_removal_threshold : minimal area of blobs to be kept
    - corners_threshold: threshold to allow corners
    - room_closing_max_length: maximum line length to add to close off open doors
    - gap_in_wall_min_threshold: minimum number of pixels to identify componenet as room instead of hole in the wall
- return
    - rooms: list of numpy arrays containing boolean masks for each detected room
    - colored_house: a colored version of the input image where each room has a random color
- image.remove_noise
  - image is filtered (img < 128 = 0, img > 128 = 255)
  - image color is converted and contours are found
  - contourArea greater than noise_removal_threshold (which is 50) is drawn on to the mask
  -  mask is returned
-  image.mark_outside_black
   -  inverse the image to see the walls of the house
   -  get the biggest contour in the img which is the house
   -  mask outside of the biggest contour to black
   -  return image and mask
      -  image: outside of the hosue is black
      -  mask: mask of the house
-  cv2.connectedComponenets
   -  give each componenets labels
-  check if each componenets is bigger than gap_in_wall_min_threshold (5000px)
-  if bigger it is defined as a room and it is given a random color

### **detect.py[precise_boxes]**
- image with colored rooms are input
- contour is drawn areound the room boxes in red
