## Finding error in output model

In the last post there was an issue where some walls were missing in the final blender output file. The reason was found in the ` calculate.remove_walls_not_in_contour() `.

The code removes wrongly detected walls which are found outside of the house contour. However, the standard on the wall is too harsh that it deleted some walls which are necessary.

Original Code was doing a pointPolygonTest checking if the bouding box of a wall is inside of the outer contour.

However I tried doing the pointPolygonTest with bounding box of the outer contour instead of just the outher contour.

It seems to have solved the problem.
