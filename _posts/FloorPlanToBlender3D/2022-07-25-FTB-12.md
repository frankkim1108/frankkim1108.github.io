## **How windows and doors are detected**

### **`def feature_match(img1, img2):`**

- using `cv2.ORB_create()` ORB keypoint detector is created
- keypoints and descriptors of floorplan image and window/door model is created
  - `cv2.detectAndCompute`
  - keypoints, descriptor is returned
  - **pt** : coordinates of the keypoint [x,y]
  - **size** : diameter of the meaningful keypoint neighborhood
  - **class_id** : object class (if the keypoints need to be clustered by an object they belong to).
- brute force matcher is created for matching keypoints and descriptors
  - `cv2.BFMatcher(cv2.NORM_HAMMING, crossCheck=True)`
- two descriptors are matched together and sorted in distance order
- from all the matching keypoints from the door model min and max x,y values are calculated
  - the width and the hight of the door model is saved for grouping the matching keypoints in the floor plan
- from all the matching keypoints from the floorplan the keypoints are grouped if the keypoints  distance is smaller than the width and the height of the door model
  - `list_grouped_matches = []`  is created
- groups with only one keyoints are deleted because rotation can't be calculated
  - `list_grouped_matches_filtered = []` is created
- corners of the door is found with `cv2.goodFeaturesToTrack()`
  - min/max of x and y value is used to find the center(origin) of the door 
  - the center(origin) point is used for rotation later
