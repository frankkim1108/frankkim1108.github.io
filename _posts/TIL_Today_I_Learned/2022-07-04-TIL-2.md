# **Today I Learned**

## **FloorplanToBlender3D**
 
## **Detect Contours**
First get the ourter contour of the floorplan, in order to create a floor of the 3d object
1. input image
2. convert image from RGB to GRAY
3. detect outer contour

### **detect.py [outer_contour]**
- cv2.threshold (230 ~ 255) thresholded image
- cv2.findContours from thresholded image
- get the largest contour
- cv2.approxPolyDP for getting approximage contour with less or same vertices
- draw contour on the original image

## **Detect Walls** 
Second we detect the wall of the floorplan. Filter is used for noise reduction and corner detection.

### **detect.py [wall_filter]**

- filter walls with cv2.threshold with wall threshold values
  - use WALL_FILTER_THRESHOLD range(0, 255)
  - use cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV + cv2.THRESH_OTSU
- Finding the background of the image
  - cv2.morphologyEX removes noise from the image leaving only the walls
    - cv2.MORPH_OPEN reduces white color noises
    - cv2.MORPH_CLOSE reduce black color noises
  - cv2.dilate dilates the image
    - when we perform erosion, it removes erosion but it can contract our object
    - dilating the image increases the object area and helps join broken parts of an object
- Find the foreground of the image
  - cv2.distanceTransform gives inforamtion about each pixel, how far they are from a pixel with 0 value
  - cv2.threshold and dist_transform is used to find the foreground
- cv2.subtract is used to subtract foreground from background to leave only the walls
